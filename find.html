		<h3>In general terms, tourism is the movement of a person from one place to another to visit and mesmerize the beauty of that place or to have fun. Moreover, the concept of traveling is considered a luxury and only people with higher income can afford this luxury.

		<h3>One’s destination is never a place, but a new way of seeing things.The best journeys in life are those that answer questions you never thought to ask.Certainly, travel is more than the seeing of sights; it is a change that goes on, deep and permanent, in the ideas of living.
		</h3>

		<h3>Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one’s lifetime.
